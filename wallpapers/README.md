- 5 space/NASA images for inspiration
- 5 minimalist designs for clean aesthetics
- 5 seasonal images (change these quarterly)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Images not appearing?**
- Check file extensions (.jpg, .png, etc.)
- Ensure images aren't corrupted
- Verify they're directly in this folder (not in subfolders)

**Wallpaper looks stretched?**
- The script automatically uses "Fill" mode for optimal display
- Images will scale to fill screen while maintaining aspect ratio
- No more stretched or distorted wallpapers!
- For best results, use images that match your screen ratio

**Script running slowly?**
- Keep collection under 100 images
- Reduce file sizes if very large (over 10MB each)
