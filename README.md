# Instant Wallpaper Changer üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Madhumith Prasanth


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Madhumith Prasanth - CUCEK

### Project Description
A completely invisible wallpaper changer designed for harmless pranks and silent demonstrations that operates with zero popup windows or detection. The system uses VBScript wrappers and Windows APIs to instantly change desktop wallpapers, install hidden startup scripts for persistent pranking, and ensure registry persistence across system reboots.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting way too comfortable with their boring desktop wallpapers and need immediate intervention. Friends' computers are suffering from chronic wallpaper monotony, and there's absolutely no way to secretly change them without triggering annoying popup windows that ruin the surprise!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An ultra-sophisticated stealth wallpaper warfare system featuring VBScript ninjas, Python commandos, and Windows API wizardry! Deploy invisible wallpaper bombs with zero detection, install persistent prank modules that survive reboots, and watch victims question their sanity as their wallpapers mysteriously change. Because clearly, the world desperately needed a way to silently terrorize desktops with complete invisibility and maximum confusion!

**Demo Explanation:** 
Upon running the script, the desktop wallpaper changes instantly to the wallpaper from the script. We demonstrate changing the wallpaper manually before restarting to verify the script's persistence across reboots. After boot-up, it takes roughly 15 seconds to load as the system services and startups initialize. The stealth script remains active until the user runs "STEALTH_REMOVE.bat" to completely uninstall it.
